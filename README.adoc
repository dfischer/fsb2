== Description

fsb2 is a preprocessor and converter of Forth source files,
under development.

Its goal is to make it easy to edit and maintain Forth source
files, in ordinary text format, for Forth systems that use
blocks.

Following some simple layout conventions, the source file can be
edited without the lack of space imposed by blocks, thus making
it possible to include detailed comments and arrange a clear
layout.
